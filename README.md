🚢 Exploring the Titanic Dataset: A Data Science Journey 📊

Embarking on a data science project, I dove deep into the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to perform comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). This task sharpened my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and identifying meaningful insights from the data.



🔍 Key Steps Undertaken:

->Data Loading and Inspection: Leveraged Pandas to load the dataset, inspect its structure, and identify key issues.

->Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, fixed data types, and handled outliers. For example, I filled missing 'Age' values with the median age and converted categorical variables like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into numerical formats.

->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize relationships between variables. Analyzed survival rates by class, gender, and age group, revealing that women and children had a higher survival rate. I also explored the correlation between 'Fare' and 'Pclass', shedding light on socioeconomic factors.

Feature Engineering: Created new features like 'FamilySize' to assess the impact of family size on survival chances.



💡 Key Insights:

->Gender and Survival: Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.

->Passenger Class: First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.

->Age Factor: Children under 10 years old had a higher survival rate.

->Family Size: Passengers traveling alone had a lower survival rate than those with family members aboard.



📈 Learning Outcomes:

Data Preprocessing: Developed proficiency in handling missing data, converting categorical variables, and managing outliers.

Visualization Techniques: Enhanced my ability to use Seaborn and Matplotlib for effective data visualization.

Statistical Analysis: Deepened my understanding of statistical methods for analyzing data relationships.



💢 This project has been a valuable experience, highlighting the importance of data cleaning, visualization, and attention to detail. I’m looking forward to taking on more exciting challenges at Prodigy InfoTech! 💢
